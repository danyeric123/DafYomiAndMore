# DafYomiAndMore
### Background
Orthodox Jews around the world study a page of Talmud every day as a way to connect with others and keep their analytical skills sharp. 
This cycle is called Daf Yomi (the daily page). See more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi)

### Description
I made a short script that calculates what page and tractate we are on in the cycle.
